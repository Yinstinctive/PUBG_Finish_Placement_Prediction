# PUBG Finish Placement Prediction
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. In either case, the last person or team left alive wins the match.<br>
We are given over 65,000 games' worth of anonymized player data, split into training and testing sets, and asked to predict final placement from final in-game stats and initial player ratings.<br>
